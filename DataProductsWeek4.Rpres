Project Description
========================================================
This project is an extension of my previous *Leaflet* projects and uses an older dataset for [Starbucks Locations in the USA](https://gist.github.com/dankohn/09e5446feb4a8faea24f). The dataset was
modified by adding a header row so *Leaflet* would recognize the latitude and longitude columns. The data classes and the first five rows, are shown below:

```{r}
kable(strtable(df))
kable(head(df,5))

```


The Shiny App
=========================================================
The Shiny app is hosted at: [Starbucks USA](https://gseamans.shinyapps.io/starbucksusa/) and has the following capabilities:

- Select a state
- Drill down
- Show the address

Using the Map (Select a State)
========================================================
In the left pane select the state to display. Once selected the map will redraw
showing the **Starbucks** locations in that state.

Using the Map (Drill Down)
========================================================
Hovering over one of the circles with a number will highlight the area that contains the **Starbucks**. Clicking on the circle will 
drill down into the area displaying addtional circles or individual **Starbucks** locations (Coffee Cups). As you drill down more map
detail will be visible.

Using the Map (Show the Address)
========================================================

Clicking on one of the coffee cup icons will cause the address, and additional information, for that **Starbucks** to be displayed.

Summary
========================================================

This simple Shiny application is for all of those who are coffee addicts, like myself. It uses a freely available dataset. The *strtable()* function 
used on the second slide was created by Jason Bryer [str Implementation for Data Frames](https://www.r-bloggers.com/str-implementation-for-data-frames/).
